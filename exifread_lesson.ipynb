    "What is EXIF Data? \n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing images on the Internet, you might have noticed that some websites provide valuable information related to those images, such as their exposure settings, camera brand, etc. This information known as “EXIF Data” can be an important source of knowledge in figuring out how photographers capture images and what tools they use in the process. In Python, we can view exif data with the Python module called exifread. The word “EXIF” is based on the Exchangeable Image File Format standard and data that photographers care about such as shutter speed, aperture, date, etc are considered EXIF data. Nowadays, every modern digital camera has the capability to record this information, along with many other camera settings, right into photographs. These settings can then be later used to organize photographs, perform searches and provide vital information to photographers about the way a particular photograph was captured. What we can do with EXIF data is exploit images to get GPS locations."
